# StockTicker
- Basic Stock app to find news and stock information.
- If you are stuck loading information, it is likely that I have run out of API calls on the free tier I use for the following API's that I use in this app (see API sources below).

### API sources: 
https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#stock-list
https://finnhub.io/docs/api

### In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
